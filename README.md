# p5 Template

Use this template to get started on p5 projects. For the most part (or in the beginning), you'll only need to edit the sketch.js file.

## Steps for running programs

Make sure you've installed a text editor (Atom is recommended) and Node.js. Also make sure you've installed http-server by typing  
  
  `npm install -g http-server` (Windows)

or Mac/Linux: 
  
  `sudo npm install -g http-server`

After everything is installed:

#### Windows:

1. Open Node.js command prompt
2. cd into the directory where your project is
3. type: http-server
4. navigate to localhost:8080 in your web browser

## Not updating?
Things aren't updating when you change and save your code? Make sure your Chrome Dev Tools are open (right click on page). Click on Network tab and make sure "disable cache" is clicked. Chrome will only disable the cache when the dev panel is open.
